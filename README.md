for background.mp3 use your own audio - put it in same directory as facedec.py

(because normal drones are boring and you deserve to be a low-budget music video star)

what does this abomination do?
drone controlled using kk2.1.5
a raspberry pi is connected to this that runs a script to record footage
what the python script doees is:
it records the footage > locally stores it > edits it to memeify it (flashing lights directory advised), adds some gen z ahh song
gives u the final edited video with audio

basically u wanna create some SICK AND AWESOME tiktoks from 50 feet in the air? WE GOTCHU COVERED
