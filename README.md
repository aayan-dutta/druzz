The Fonk-Drone (druzz) is basically a “flying Photoshop machine with commitment issues”—a drone that should be capable of great aerial photography but instead chooses to be completely useless.

Built with a KK2.1 flight controller, 1000KV motors, and 10-inch propellers, this quadcopter has all the right hardware for smooth, high-quality footage. But instead of doing what a normal drone does, we made sure it actively sabotages itself. Thanks to an onboard Raspberry Pi running OpenCV, it takes whatever footage it captures and butchers it into cursed, fonk-style memes—filled with distortion, oversaturation, and chaotic warping that make the videos completely unwatchable.

In short, this drone is a walking (or rather, flying) contradiction. It looks impressive on paper, but the moment it takes off, all it does is produce glitchy, low-effort garbage. It’s the pinnacle of engineered uselessness—a machine designed with precision and effort, only to spectacularly fail at the one job it was built for.
